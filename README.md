# TripleBronze
Made with BepinEx and Harmony.
Triples the amount of bronze you get with each craft so that crafting bronze is consistent (1 tin ingot + 2 copper ingots = 3 bronze ingots)
Place `.dll` file in to Valheim/BepinEx/plugins/ folder.
Requires BepinEx.

Includes a patch that adds recipes from ore->ingot to avoid using Smelters and Coal Kilns (because of lag reasons) and save time.
Enable this in the config file.
